### Chundersnatch.com
A 'Game' wherein you click a button, generating a series of random emjoi's (and their descriptions as a paragraph).
The 'Player' can choose to have the browser speak the paragraph aloud, using a selected voice.
This is fairly useless and is intented as an annoyance machine written in Javascript.

#### Game Legend:

| icon | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔊 | Choose voice |
| 😃 | Show Emoji 'paragraph' |
| ✏️ | Show text 'paragraph' |

Clicking the "Say This" button will speak the emoji 'paragraph'.

#### FAQ:
 - Q: Can I change the speed/pitch/tone?
 - <s>A: No, not yet...it's in the code, but that's where I left off.</s>
 - A: Yes! Click on the ✏️ icon and you will find both!

 - Q: Why is the selected voice not working?
 - A: You probably don't have that localized language pack installed in the browser. To fix this, change your system language. (<-- not responsible for your broken OS)
 
 - Q: What do I win if I get the highest score?
 - A: The satisfaction of knowing you created the largest nonsensical collection of partial & run-on sentences by clicking a button.
